To make sure all mocks are being cleared between tests, itâ€™s important to add the following lines to afterEach :

```TypeScript
    afterEach( () => {
        vi.clearAllMocks();
        vi.resetAllMocks();
        vi.resetModules();
        vi.restoreAllMocks();
    });
```
*I had the unpleasant surprise to have the mockImplemention from spyOn not being cleared when doing a simple clearAllMocks. Adding all those cleared the issue.*
